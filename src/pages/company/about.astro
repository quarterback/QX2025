      <h1>About This Work</h1>
      <p>
        I explore how technology, bureaucracy, and institutional systems shape public life. My work focuses on the concept of <strong>Consequence Design</strong>—a framework for examining the hidden harms and power structures embedded in service delivery, interface logic, and digital infrastructure.

    <p>
      Across roles in government, academia, and the design profession, I’ve worked to make complex systems more intelligible—and more accountable. That includes helping agencies improve service delivery, but also challenging the assumptions behind why systems are built the way they are in the first place.

    <p>
      This site is a space for research and reflection. Some of the work here traces my ongoing study of <strong>interface governance</strong>, <strong>AI affordances</strong>, <strong>administrative harm</strong>, and <strong>institutional resilience</strong>. I also explore how platform logic has transformed society’s capacity to respond to crises, deliver care, and maintain public trust.

      If you're looking for more structured frameworks and critical writing, head to <a href="https://consequencedesign.org" class="underline">consequencedesign.org</a>. That's where I publish essays and notes through the <a href="/journal/" class="underline">Journal</a>, which builds out the ideas of consequence theory, hype studies, and interface critique.

      This work is ongoing, and intentionally unfinished. If you’re doing something aligned—or want to challenge the ideas here—I’d love to hear from you.
