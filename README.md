# QX2025 (Odyssey Fork)

**QX2025** is a minimalist publishing system for critical design writing, strategic foresight, and cultural theory. It is a heavily modified fork of the Odyssey Astro theme, rebuilt to host a growing archive of research, essays, and frameworks around consequence design, interface politics, and hype studies.

This site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build), focused on performance, legibility, and timeless web aesthetics. It‚Äôs meant for writing that endures‚Äînot for launch week hype.

## What's Different in This Fork?

- üé® **Custom Global Styles** ‚Äì Rewritten global stylesheet using Google Fonts (`Martel`, `IBM Plex Mono`) for an editorial look with clear hierarchy.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Content-First Philosophy** ‚Äì Designed for longform text, citations, and structured writing over flashy marketing blocks.
- üß† **Integrated Theoretical Frameworks** ‚Äì Built to showcase critical research projects like Interface Memetics, Crisis Cascades, and Consequence Design.
- üìö **Speculative Design Focus** ‚Äì Not a startup boilerplate. This fork is optimized for thought leadership, cultural criticism, and systems thinking.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quarterback/QX2025.git
cd QX2025
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser.

## Customizing

Start by editing the site metadata in `src/config/settings.js`:

```js
export default {
  title: `Out of Scope`,
  description: `Writing at the edge of consequence, interface, and institutional design.`,
  url: `https://consequencedesign.org`, // Or wherever you deploy
  name: `QX2025`,
  enableThemeSwitcher: false,
};
```

Then swap out global styles in `src/styles/global.css` and edit nav items via `src/config/nav.js`.

## Deploy

You can deploy this to [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), or any static host.

Here‚Äôs how to build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then follow [Astro‚Äôs deployment guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) for your platform of choice.
